Stock Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts stock price trends using LSTM-based deep learning models for time series forecasting. It leverages historical stock data to forecast future prices and assist in informed investment decisions.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

📊 Features

Load and preprocess historical stock price data

Visualize trends and patterns in stock prices

Train LSTM model for time series prediction

Predict future stock prices and evaluate model performance

⚡ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/pallaviaddanki/Stock-Price-Prediction.git


Navigate to the project folder:

cd Stock-Price-Prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Load your dataset (CSV file with stock prices).

Run the notebook or script to preprocess data and train the model.

Use the trained model to predict future stock prices.

📂 Dataset

Historical stock data (CSV) can be obtained from sources like Yahoo Finance
 or Kaggle.

Ensure your dataset contains Date and Close columns for proper training.

📈 Results

Visualizations of actual vs predicted stock prices

Evaluation metrics like RMSE to assess model performance

✨ Future Improvements

Integrate multiple features (volume, technical indicators) for better predictions

Build a web interface for real-time predictions

Compare multiple deep learning models (GRU, Bi-LSTM)
